## What is Markdown file?

This is my first time using a markdown file.  But it is used as a lightweight markup language that we can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

In this file, I'll reflect upon what I have learned so far, what skills I have obtained and what this project will be.

- How to create and operate a virtual desktop using ubuntu/linux operating systems
- The definition and function of the worldwide web, internet, servers and other relevant terms or info
- How to operate the terminal and use command lines to create, delete or move files and directories
- The basics of HTML and CSS

As for this project, I'll create a recipes page using the skills and knowledge that I have acquired.
